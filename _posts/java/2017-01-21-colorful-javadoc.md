# Colorful Javadoc  

  
  
Do you access Javadoc quite frequently and have downloaded Javadoc for all your favorite Java tools and libraries? Do you think you can add some more color to Javadoc? Do you think you can exercise your CSS skills on something the you frequently use? Well, customizing Javadoc is easy!  
  
If you have not already downloaded Javadoc for your favorite library, do it now! In this article, we focus on customizing [Java SE 8 Javadoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html).  
  
The following are the Java SE color style-sheets that are available for download!

Steps to use the downloaded style sheet  

1.  Extract the downloaded [Javadoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html) to say "C:\\Javadoc\\JDK"
2.  Change to "api" directory under "C:\\Javadoc\\JDK"
3.  Rename stylesheet.css as stylesheet_orig.css
4.  Download your favorite Java SE8 color style sheet from above and save it as "stylesheet.css"
5.  Refresh "C:\\Javadoc\\JDK\\api\\index.html" using a HTML browser.  
    

## Adding customizations  

After downloading and extracting the Javadocs for your favorite library, browse the directory structure to locate a file called "stylesheet.css". This is the CSS file that determines the look and feel of your Javadoc. Now, we would want try our customizations, but not tamper with the original as well. So, rename the stylesheet.css as stylesheet_orig.css. Create a new file called stylesheet.css with the following content.  
  
```java
@import url('stylesheet_orig.css');
```
We shall be including the original style sheet but overriding the CSS selectors that we wish to customize.Â   
  
For example, the following entries in styesheet.css shall include the original but override the body to have a White background color and a Black foreground color.  
```java
@import url('stylesheet_orig.css');  
  
body   
{  
    background-color:#ffffff;  
    color:Black;  
    margin:0;  
}
```
Save your customizations and open the "index.html" of the Javadoc APIs and refresh to see them take effect.
