# Groovy: Platfrom independent scripts using Java

  
This document sees Groovy in light of Java developer wishing to create custom commands by writing platform independent scripts. Moving  Java code to Groovy is not seamless, but not tedious as well. However, there are differences that needs explicit care. To begin with a Java developer needs to go through [Differences With Java](http://www.groovy-lang.org/differences.html). However, there are subtle aspects that might require explicit mention. Hopefully, this article address at least few such cases.  
  

## Initializing a String array  

```java
/* Java Code */  
String name[] = new String [] {"apple", "bat", "cat"};  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
String[] name = ["apple", "bat", "cat"];
```
Note  

*   The syntax `\["apple", "bat", "cat"\]` creates a List. However, we can assign the List to an array to get an array of String.
*   Java supports both of the following syntaxes for creating arrays. Groovy supports only the first one.  
    

*   `String\[\] name`  
    
*   `String name\[\]`  
    

## Passing String array as argument

```java
/* Java Code */  
fun (new String [] {"apple", "bat", "cat"});  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
fun (["apple", "bat", "cat"] as String[]);  
  
/* Common code*/  
void fun (String[] name)  
{  
   for (String currName : name)  
      println (currName);  
}
```
Since `\["apple", "bat", "cat"\]` creates a List. The Java code shown above results in java.lang.ClassCastException in Groovy.  

## Passing char as argument  

```java
/* Java Code */  
fun ('#');  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
fun ('#' as char);  
  
/* Common code*/  
void fun (char ch)  
{  
 println ("Char=" \+ ch)  
}
```

## Visibility - Script global variables

```java
import groovy.transform.Field;  
  
String a = "apple";  
  
@Field  
String b = "bat";  
  
println ("A for " \+ a); // Works  
println ("B for " \+ b); // Works  
fun ();  
  
public void fun ()  
{  
   println ("Fun: A for " \+ a); // Does not work!  
   println ("Fun: B for " \+ b); // Works  
}  

```
While writing Groovy scripts, a variable outside all the functions (Lets say, main area) is not a global variable as one might expect. These variables are local to the code in main area. In order to create a variable analogous to instance variable or script global variable, annotate the declaration with "@Field".  Note: This requires "`import groovy.transform.Field`"  

## Closures Instead of Lambda

Below are few examples where Groovy closures were written to replace the Java's lambda expressions.  

### Iteration  

```java
/* Java Code */  
List<String\> list = Arrays.asList("fish", "ink", "jug", "bat", "apple", "cat", "egg");  
list.forEach((s) -> System.out.println (s));  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
List<String\> list = ["fish", "ink", "jug", "bat", "apple", "cat", "egg"];  
list.forEach({s -> println (s)});
```

### Sort using comparator  

```java
/* Java Code */  
list.sort((s1,s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
list.sort({s1,s2 -> s1.compareTo(s2)});
```

### Stream

```java
/* Java Code */  
list.stream()  
    .filter((s) -> s.length() <= 3)  
    .sorted((s1,s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2))  
    .forEach((s) -> System.out.println (s));  
  
/* Groovy Code */  
list.stream()  
    .filter({s -> s.length() <= 3})  
    .sorted({s1,s2 -> s1.compareTo(s2)})  
    .forEach({s -> println (s)});  
  

```
Note the following syntax differences  

*   Closures are surrounded by braces { }. Not the case in lambda.
*   Lambda parameters are surrounded by parenthesis (). Not the case in closure.  
    

Groovy archive comes with a big list of JAR files and executables for Linux and windows. You could create your own groovy executable, include custom JARs in path and use this to execute your groovy scripts as well. (Similar to [BeanShell](https://blogs.oracle.com/brewing-tests/entry/beanshell_platfrom_independent_scripts_using)). However, unfortunately, BeanShell that was both light weight and seamless to a Java programmer is not maintained. It does not support generics or lambda expressions. So, If you are looking for scripting using Java, [Javascript is not Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_javascript.xml) and if the cocktail of including Java within Javascirpt (and/or vice versa) does not appeal to you then Groovy is the way to go.  
  
Hopefully, the dream of having a scripting language closest to Java is kept alive by Groovy!
